# Feedback on Final

Interesting final project.  I appreciate the important of agriculture and nutrition to healthcare. A few notes.
1. Your series of `stateN` functions is not a very good use of abstraction.  Think about how you could have created one function called `stateN(row, state)` that would have checked for whatever `state` you passed in.
2. One of the requirements was to combine your data sets via a merge on concat. I didn't see that in your project.
3. I could have used a bit more explanation along the way to help me understand the calculations you were doing.

Overall, I think you did a good job demonstrating most of the skills we learned this semester.
